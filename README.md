### Pilot #2: 402 EOP students at Fresno State, Chico State, and CSU, Northridge

---

Food insecurity among college students is a serious problem that can impact student performance in the classroom and ultimately effect student success. The Center for Healthy Communities (CHC) developed the Basic Needs Student Success Survey (BNS3) and administered it to undergraduate students participating in the Educational Opportunity Program (EOP) at Chico State, Fresno State and CSU, Northridge from November 25th, 2020 to March 24th, 2021. The EOP office assisted in the recruitment and provided computers for students to take the survey. Participants were given a $25 gift card for their participation. EOP students were identified as the target population for this survey based upon their low-income and first-generation student status, which indicates a higher probability of CalFresh eligibility.

The purpose of this second cross-sectional pilot study was to revise the BNS3 tool and validate student perception of the following:

* The impact of receiving CalFresh assistance.
* The impact of utilization of the campus food pantry on their health, nutrition, cooking confidence, time management and academic performance.

This report provides a top level descriptive analysis of each question in the survey. Researchers and campus staff are encouraged to review the information in this analysis to formulate additional research questions and hypotheses.

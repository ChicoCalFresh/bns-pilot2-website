<h1 class="title toc-ignore">Workload</h1>

</div>


<p>The following questions were asked in regards to the weekly workload taken on by students. This includes work from both paid/unpaid jobs, as well as time spent caregiving for a family member. Students academic workload is also looked at in order to see the hours spent each week on school work, as well as looking at the combined hours across academic and non-academic responsibilities.</p>
<div id="weekly-paid-work-hours" class="section level2">
<h2>Weekly Paid Work Hours</h2>
<p><strong>Estimate the number of hours you work in a PAID job (for example, server at a restaurant, office assistant, etc.) or paid internship (for example, training, shadowing, or practicum) per week. (n=387, 93% of 415 reporting).</strong> <img src="Workload_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png" width="576" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /> Figure 3.1: Weekly Paid Hour Ranges</p>
<p>It seems that the majority of people work either part-time or not at all. Only a small number of people are considered to be working full-time (40 or more hours per week). Below is a breakdown of the exact paid hours worked by survey participants as well as the impacts that COVID had on their hours.</p>
<div id="exact-hours-breakdown" class="section level3">
<h3>Exact Hours Breakdown</h3>
<p>Although the majority of the participants claim to work 0 hours per week, below is a breakdown of the exact number of hours for those who claim to work a paid job (n=260, 63% of 415 reporting). <img src="Workload_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png" width="816" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /> Figure 3.2: Weekly Paid Hours Distribution</p>
<p><em>Note that “41+” was rounded for 41 in the following analysis for the paid hours worked per week</em>.</p>
<p>The average number of paid hours worked per week (denoted by the dotted line) is 24, while the median is 20 hours. It seems that the majority of students are considered part-time workers (less than 40 hours per week), with 20 hours being most common (NA people) and 40 hours following that.</p>
</div>
<div id="impact-of-covid" class="section level3">
<h3>Impact of COVID</h3>
<p><strong>Have the hours you work in a PAID job or internship changed due to COVID-19? (n=366, 88% of 415 reporting).</strong> <img src="Workload_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png" width="768" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /> Figure 3.3: COVID Impact on Paid Hours</p>
<p>With the impact of COVID, it seems that most people were able to keep their current paid jobs with only slight changes. 108 people had their hours decrease, 87 people maintained the same hours, and 30 people had their hours increase. There was also 68 people who claimed that they no longer had their paid position due to the impact of COVID, while 73 people also claimed that they did not have a paid position before COVID.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="unpaid-work-hours" class="section level2">
<h2>Unpaid Work Hours</h2>
<p><strong>Estimate the number of hours you work in an UNPAID internship (for example, training, shadowing, practicum, and/or volunteer, etc.). Do not combine with answers above. (n=385, 93% of 415 reporting).</strong> <img src="Workload_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png" width="576" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /> Figure 3.4: Weekly Unpaid Hour Ranges</p>
<p>We can see that the majority of people (296) do not work an unpaid job. A small number of people work part-time at an unpaid job and only a select few people work full-time at an unpaid job. Below is a breakdown of the number of unpaid hours worked per week.</p>
<div id="exact-hours-breakdown-1" class="section level3">
<h3>Exact Hours Breakdown</h3>
<p>Although the majority of the participants claim to work 0 hours per week, below is a breakdown of the exact number of hours for those who claim to work a unpaid job (n=89, 21% of 415 reporting). <img src="Workload_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-8-1.png" width="816" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /> Figure 3.5: Weekly Unpaid Hours Distribution</p>
<p><em>Note that “41+” was rounded for 41 in the following analysis for the unpaid hours worked per week</em>.</p>
<p>The average number of unpaid hours worked per week (denoted by the dotted line) is 14.97, while the median is 10 hours. It seems that the majority of students do not work unpaid positions, with 41 hours being most common (13 people) and 10 hours following that.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="unpaid-caregiving-hours" class="section level2">
<h2>Unpaid Caregiving Hours</h2>
<p><strong>Estimate the number of hours you spend each week on unpaid family obligations (for example, taking care of younger siblings, preparing family meals, running errands for the family, etc.). (n=387, 93% of 415 reporting).</strong> <img src="Workload_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-9-1.png" width="576" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /> Figure 3.6: Weekly Caregiving Hour Ranges</p>
<p>It seems that the majority of people in the data do spend some time each week caring for family members. Only 59 people estimated that they spent 0 hours per week for family obligations. There are also around the same number of people who estimated they work full-time (40 or more hours per week) on these family obligations. Below is a breakdown of these unpaid hours spent on family obligations each week.</p>
<div id="exact-hours-breakdown-2" class="section level3">
<h3>Exact Hours Breakdown</h3>
<p>Although some of the participants claim to work 0 hours per week, below is a breakdown of the exact number of hours for those who claim to spend time on unpaid family obligations (n=328, 79% of 415 reporting). <img src="Workload_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-11-1.png" width="816" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /> Figure 3.7: Weekly Caregiving Hours Distribution</p>
<p><em>Note that “41+” was rounded for 41 in the following analysis for the unpaid caregiving hours worked per week</em>.</p>
<p>The average number of unpaid caregiving hours worked per week (denoted by the dotted line) is 17.45, while the median is 12 hours. There does not seem to be a clear pattern in the number of unpaid caregiving hours worked, with 41 hours being most common (47 people) and 20 hours following that (43 people).</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="academic-workload" class="section level2">
<h2>Academic Workload</h2>
<p><strong>Below is a breakdown of the academic workload, using the 3 hours of work per unit measurement (n=393, 95% of 415 reporting).</strong> <em>Note that values denoted as “22+” are now “66+”, but were rounded to 66 for the analysis below</em>. <img src="Workload_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-14-1.png" width="672" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /> Figure 3.8: Academic Hours Distribution</p>
<p>The average number of academic hours worked per week (denoted by the dotted line) is 40.95, while the median is 42 hours. The majority of students do seem to be working 36 or more hours per week, with 36 hours being most common (113 people) and 45 hours following that (92 people).</p>
</div>
<div id="non-academic-workload" class="section level2">
<h2>Non-Academic Workload</h2>
<p><strong>Below is a combination of both paid and unpaid hours worked by students to get a further understanding of the workload participants face on a weekly basis. The values are also filtered so that only people who worked (more than 0 hours in total) were included (n=282, 68% of 415 reporting).</strong> <em>Note that values denoted as “41+” were added together to form “82+”, but are rounded to 82 for the analysis below</em>. <img src="Workload_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-16-1.png" width="768" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /> Figure 3.9: Non-Academic Hours Distribution</p>
<p>The average number of total hours worked per week (denoted by the dotted line) is 26.85, while the median is 25 hours. The majority of students do seem to be working under 40 hours per week in total, with 20 hours being most common (31 people) and 40 hours following that (31 people).</p>
</div>
<div id="total-workload" class="section level2">
<h2>Total Workload</h2>
<p><strong>Below is a combination of all worked hours per week, both academic and non-academic. This includes units (3 hr/unit), paid, and unpaid worked hours (n=394, 95% of 415 reporting).</strong> <em>Note that values denoted as “41+” and “22+” were rounded to 41 and 22 (respectively) for the below analysis</em>. <img src="Workload_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-18-1.png" width="768" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /> Figure 3.10: Total Workload Hours Distribution</p>
<p>The average number of total hours worked per week (denoted by the dotted line) is 60.06, while the median is 60 hours. The majority of students do seem to be working over full-time in total, with 45 hours being most common (35 people) and 36 hours following that (26 people).</p>
</div>
<div id="calfresh-workload" class="section level2">
<h2>CalFresh Workload</h2>
<p>People are required to meet a certain work criteria in order to receive CalFresh benefits. All able-bodied adults are required to work a minimum of 80 hours per month, which can be broken down into roughly 20 hours per week. This can be either paid or unpaid work, and more information on this requirement can be found on the <a href="https://www.cdss.ca.gov/inforesources/calfresh/abawd#:~:text=People%20who%20are%20ABAWDs%20must,%2C%20and%20in%2Dkind%20work.">Department of Social Services</a> website. If you are an student, you may be enrolled in at least 6 academic units or more (equivalent to 18+ hours per week of academic workload) rather than having a paid/unpaid job. For more information on student eligibility, see the <a href="https://www.csuchico.edu/calfresh/basics/college-student-eligibility.shtml">College Student Eligibility</a> requirements on Chico State’s website.</p>
<p>The below graphs breaks down if a person meets the workload requirements based solely on one of the following criteria:</p>
<ul>
<li>Academic workload - enrolled in 6 or more units (18 or more hours).</li>
<li>Paid Workload - working 20+ weekly hours at a paid position.</li>
<li>Unpaid Workload - working 20+ weekly hours at a unpaid position.</li>
<li>Total Workload - working 20+ weekly hours in total (combination of academic, paid, and unpaid).</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Note: people with a workload of 0 hours were included in the graph and analysis.</em> <img src="Workload_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-19-1.png" width="768" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /> Figure 3.11: CalFresh Workload Qualification Breakdown</p>
<ul>
<li>Looking at the academic workload, we can see a large majority of them are taking more than 6 units and are meet the eligibility requirements (383 people). A very small minority of participants are not taking more than 6 units and do not meet the eligibility requirements (10 people).</li>
<li>Looking at the paid workload, we can see that less than half of them work 20 or more hours per week and meet the eligibility requirements (167 people). A little over half work less than 20 hours per week and do not meet the eligibility requirements (220 people).</li>
<li>Looking at the unpaid workload, we can see that only a minority of them work 20 or more hours per week and meet the eligibility requirements (25 people). The vast majority work less than 20 hours per week and do not meet the eligibility requirements (360 people).</li>
<li>Looking at the total workload, we can see that the majority of them work 20 or more hours per week and meet the eligibility requirements (390 people). Only a small number work less than 20 hours per week and do not meet the eligibility requirements (4 people).</li>
